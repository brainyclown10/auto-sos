# AutoSOS
SpartaHack IV project.

## Idea
Uber for car repair. For people who need help with their car right now (booth people who want to offer help and those in need of help).

## Architecture
We decided to move on with React Native. This decision was informed
by the segment of the people we are targeting. An mobile app for people stuck
in the middle of nowhere would be more helpful sincen they would be more likely
to have access to a mobile phone with Internet access than a laptop or desktop computer. Using React Native also
shortens our development time. 

## Workflow
- [x] Brainstorm features
- [ ] Coming up with a rough software architecture
- [x] Choosing a framework
- [ ] Start with a boilerplate
- [ ] Divide Responsibilities
- [ ] Test and code
- [ ] User Testing
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Submit!

Put an `x` between `[ ]` the braces, like this `[x]` to check off!
