# AutoSOS
SpartaHack IV project.

## Idea
Uber for car repair. For people who need help with their car right now.

## Architecture
We decided to move on with React Native (yay!). This decision is informed
by the segment of the people we are targetting. An webapp for people stuck
in the middle of nowhere needing help with their car would be more likely
to have access to a mobile phone than a full-fledged laptop. Using RN also
shorten the development time. 

## Workflow
- [x] Brainstorm features
- [ ] Coming up with a rough software architecture
- [x] Choosing a framework
- [ ] Start with a boilerplate
- [ ] Divide Responsibilities
- [ ] Test and code
- [ ] User Testing
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Submit!

Put an `x` between `[ ]` the braces, like this `[x]` to check off!
